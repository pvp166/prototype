Sell Pages/Posts through WooCommerce 2.6+ quickly and easily. Tested up to WooCommerce Version 9.0.x

== Description ==
Quickly and easily sell access to pages, posts and custom post types through WooCommerce with Pay For Post with WooCommerce.  I originally created this plugin because I looked everywhere, and I couldn't find a plugin already out there, free or premium, that would do the simple fact of selling access to a particular page or post through WooCommerce.  So I decided to write my own.

= Requirements =
* WooCommerce version 2.6+ to be installed and active
* **Guest checkout to be turned OFF**
* PHP 7.4+ is required

= How It Works =
Getting everything setup will take you less than 5 minutes with three simple steps.

- **Step 1** Create a product in WooCommerce
- **Step 2** Create a page or post in WordPress
- **Step 3** Associate your product with your page using the Pay For Post with WooCommerce meta box.

**It's that simple.**

>With the Premium version, you have several other options for protecting content like, time based, number of page views, etc.

= Shortcodes =

`[woocommerce-payperpost template='purchased']`
This outputs an unordered list of the posts that have been purchased by the current user logged in.

>There are several additional shortcodes available in the free and premium version.  Take a look at [https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/](https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/) for other available shortcodes.

= Template Functions =
**IMPORTANT** Out of the box this plugin will work with any theme which uses the standard Wordpress function `the_content()`. For those themes that do not utilize `the_content()` you can use the following static functions in your templates.

`Woocommerce_Pay_Per_Post_Helper::has_access()`
This checks if the current user has access to the page.  It returns true/false

`Woocommerce_Pay_Per_Post_Helper::get_no_access_content()`
This returns the content specified in the PPP Options.

>For a full example of this take a look at [https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/](https://pramadillo.com/plugins/woocommerce-pay-per-post/)

== Installation ==
1. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
1. Browse to Admin->WooCommerce PayPerPost->Settings

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do you offer installation and customization services? =
Yes, if you need help with installation and/or would like additional customization work done for your website, you can fill out a request form at [https://pramadillo.com/support](https://pramadillo.com/support)

= I wish this plugin had XZY feature =

While I try to do my best to incorporate new features all the time, I implemented a new Feature Request board located at [https://pramadillo.com/feature-requests](https://pramadillo.com/feature-requests)

= The output from the shortcode to display the products needed to purchase to view content looks weird =
This is a default shortcode from WooCommerce.  Take a look at https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-shortcodes/#section-9

Another thing you can try is to set the number of columns on the shortcode to disply only 1 column to do that you can change your shortcode to be [products ids='{{product_id}}' cols='1']


= Can this plugin work with custom post types? =

Yes, this plugin worked with all custom post types.  In the settings you can add and remove which post types you would like the metabox to show up on.

= How do you link to your post after an order has been placed? =

Use the premium version. :) The premium version handles this for you.  However, if you are using the free version what I have done in the past is use the Order Notes for the product in WooCommerce. So what will happen is after they purchase, on the Payment Received page they will see the order notes, and they will get sent in the receipt also.

So for instance, I have a Vimeo video that I embed in a page, on the Vimeo Product in WooCommerce I add the Password and notes on how to view the video, they gets transmitted via email and on the thank you page for the user.

**For PREMIUM users, there is a built-in option to include the post links in the order email, confirmation screen and on the users My Account page.**

= Do I need to have user accounts turned on? =

Yes, in order to keep track of who purchased what, it is a requirement that all customers have user accounts/

= Do you offer support? =

Yes, I do the absolute best I can to support the free version of the plugin.  If you upgrade to the premium version you will have priority support.
